# UX

My UX process was to analyze the customer’s requirements and try and think of different ways to implement this in an easy manner for the user. 

## The client’s requirements are:

    To be able to register and sign into an account.
    To be able to create, edit, delete and view products on their account.
    To be able to leave a review once they've purchased a particular product.
    To be able to contact the company for any queries via a contact form.
    To be able to sort through previous reviews to make judgement on items.

## User stories:

    As a user I want to be able to create an account.
    As a user I want to be able to setup a personal profile.
    As a user I want to be able to create, edit and delete my own orders.
    As a user I want to be able to send the company an email with any queries I have.
    As a user I want to be able to sort through reviews by different criteria's.
    As a user I want to view other user’s reviews.
    As a user I want be able to see a users review in detail. 
    As a user I want to be able to log out of my account.

# Deployment

I've been using AWS Cloud 9 While developing this app. Throughout the development I used GitHub to keep track of changes.

The development version of my application is on GitHub and I push this code using git push origin master.

I've done all my testing on a local database which doesn't get uploaded to GitHub.
